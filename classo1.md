# HTML describes the structure of a web page 
+ Tags:
> act like containers. They tell you 
something about the information that lies 
between their opening and closing tags

> provide additional information 
about the contents of an element. They appear 
on the opening tag of the element and are 
made up of two parts: a name and a value, 
separated by an equals sign

# Looking at How Other sites are Built
+ one of the most common 
ways to learn about HTML and 
discover new tips and techniques 
was to look at the source code 
that made up web pages and the server sends to you.
# Extra Markup
+ Since the web was first created, there have 
been several different versions of HTML.
HTML 4 then XHTML 1.0 and then finally HTML5 which is not completed yet and you can 
safely take advantage of the 
new features of the language as 
long as you endeavour to ensure 
that users with older browsers 
will be able to view your pages 
(even though some of the extra 
features will not be visible to 
them)
>Each new version was designed 
to be an improvement on the 
last (with new elements and 
attributes added and older code 
removed)
+ DOCTYPE declaration tell a 
browser which version of HTML 
the page is using

# HTML5 Layout
> HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the 
parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content 
you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not 
stopped many web page authors using them already.
The new elements provide clearer code (compared 
with using multiple <div> elements).
+  Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 
elements need to be told which elements are 
block-level elements.
+ To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 
(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, 
which is available free from Google
# PROCESS & Design
+ Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site
+ Wireframes allow you to organize the information that 
will need to go on each page.
+ You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify 
the information you present
